*1*: How to add new matrices:
To add a new matrix has to be create a new txt-csv "configuration file" named conf(matrix's dimensione).
The configuration file is composed by:
1 A list of comma separated integers(0,1,-1) which begins with # -> These values represent the colors of the matrix (1:white,-1:black,0:grey)
2 A list of comma separated integers(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) which begins with @ -> These values represent the indices of the "forbidden" cells
3 r followed by a comma and a number -> This is the rows numbers
